# My Task 

This app is designed to manage and track tasks efficiently using Jetpack Compose for the UI. Initially, it fetches task data from an API and stores it in a local Room database, ensuring data persistence. Users can easily interact with the tasks by adding new ones, editing existing tasks, or deleting them as needed. Each task includes a checkbox to mark its completion status, allowing users to track progress visually. The data remains persistent within the Room database, ensuring that changes are saved even after the app is closed and reopened.
